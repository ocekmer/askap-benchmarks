# 2023 GPU PACER Workshop & Hackathon
## TO DO List
- HIP Concurrency & pinned memory on ***Gridding*** & ***Degridding***
- Using ***thrust*** library for ***CLEAN*** algorithm
- Integration of the developed kernels into YandaSoft & check performance gain
- ~~Create a hello class for the kernels to check the used chiplet (slurm socket) & GPU combination~~
- ***Omniperf*** and ***Omnitrace*** will be used to profile the codes
- Continuous roofline analysis for each developed kernel 
- SYCL?

## Completed
- Create a hello class for the kernels to check the used chiplet (slurm socket) & GPU combination
